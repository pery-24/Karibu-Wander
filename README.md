## ✨ About Karibu Wander  
Traveling Africa should feel magical — but most young Africans travel alone, don’t know where to go, or can’t find people who match their vibe.

I built **Karibu Wander** for Africans who want to explore Africa with **friends, not strangers**.  
For those who love sunrise safaris, jollof vs. pilau debates, Maasai sunsets, and spontaneous road trips.  

Karibu Wander is the first platform that helps Africans:  
- Discover Africa’s most beautiful destinations  
- Match with real travel buddies  
- Build squads  
- Plan epic adventures together  

This is **Africa by Africans, for Africans**.
